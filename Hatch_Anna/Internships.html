<p>Hatch internships are available to youth aged 16-19 who have not yet received their high school diploma or equivalent. An internship is an exciting way to learn all of the Hatch equipment and customer service skills in a safe, inclusive, and structured environment. </p>
<p>Interns will help Hatch visitors with their projects, including giving tours, helping to find materials and equipment, and specific help with 3D printing, laser cutting, sewing, electronics, vinyl cutting, computers, and/or woodworking.</p>
<p>Interns are expected to complete a one-hour orientation and be at Hatch for a total of 36 hours over 4-8 weeks. Interns will receive community service hours for their time at Hatch once they complete a final presentation. For their final presentation, interns will choose one technology area with which they are previously unfamiliar and create a final project that they will present to the Hatch community. See Final Project information below.</p>
<p>Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Hatch cannot accept more than one intern at a time.</p>
